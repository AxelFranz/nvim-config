# NeoVim config file

So i've been using neovim for a while so I thought it might be useful to share a fully documented config file that i'm using everyday.

To enable my config file you need :
- Plug installed : `curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`

Then, just copy the file to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`
Restart Vim and use `:PlugInstall`. After another start, everything should be fine
